# 💳 CreditRepay Predictor

This project aims to predict whether a customer will be able to repay credit using machine learning techniques. It can assist financial institutions in assessing risk before approving loans or credit lines.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on credit features
- Built classification models using **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Tree**, and **Random Forest**
- Evaluated model performance using **confusion matrix**, **accuracy**, and **ROC AUC**
- Included **feature selection** and **scaling** techniques for improvement

## 📊 Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**

## 📁 Files

- `CreditRepay Predictor.ipynb`: Main notebook with code and outputs
- `data/`: Contains the dataset
- `images/`: Visualizations generated
- `requirements.txt`: Required libraries

## ✅ Sample Output
